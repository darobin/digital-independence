    <h1>Towards European Digital Independence</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Building the Euro Stack</p>

    <p>
      <span class="lead">A New European Digital Deal.</span>
      <span class="sublead">We want the European Union to gain leadership in digital technologies that are crucial for 
      our democracy, our security, and our prosperity.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      For this purpose, we must leverage Europe's strengths: openness, diversity, the ability to work together as a 
      network, talent, and creativity. As a first step on that journey we are convening a unique set of leading experts
      from around the world to share real-world experience and showcase what digital public infrastructure is, how it 
      works, how it maximises benefits for citizens, innovators, public administrations, and how Europe can build it. 
    </p>
    <ul class="details">
      <li><strong>when</strong>: September 24, 2024 from 15:00 to 18:00</li>
      <li><strong>where</strong>: European Parliament</li>
      <li><strong>convened by</strong>: MEPs Axel Voss (EPP), Alexandra  Geese (Greens) XXX</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In the past mandate, the European Union pioneered key regulation to tackle the dominance of Big Tech 
      gatekeepers and to shape a democratic information ecosystem in the digital realm. Nevertheless, 
      Europe still heavily relies on US tech corporations that stifle competition and innovation, and 
      take possession of the world's creativity. We witness autocratic regimes investing higher shares 
      of GDP in digital technologies than European democracies. Now is the time to create open standards and 
      digital infrastructure that boost the competitiveness of European companies, to seize economic opportunities for 
      cooperation with other parts of the world that have been fostering and investing in digital autonomy (e.g. India, 
      Brazil, Taiwan), and to enhance the resilience of our democracy. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The "European Digital Deal" focuses on three major components: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        open protocols and open source software operated under democratic governance to liberate the potential and 
        increase the competitiveness of European companies and start-ups;
      </li>
      <li>
        a robust investment programme in a 'European Digital Stack': hardware, bandwidth, infrastructures for data creation, 
        collection, and storage that such protocols will run on;
      </li>
      <li>
        strong and effective competition enforcement and regulation.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We have secured participation from
      <span class="person">Sujith Nair</span> from the India Stack,
      <span class="person">Audrey Tang</span> former Digital minister of Taiwan, and
      <span class="person">Luca Belli</span> who works on Brazil's digital sovereignty.
      We have support from 
      <span class="person">SITRA</span> the innovation fund arm of the Finnish Government,
      the <span class="person">German Sovereign Tech Fund</span>, and 
      the <span class="person">EDIC on Digital Commons</span>.
      We have participation from 
      <span class="person">Project Liberty</span> in the US/Europe,
      and from a large number of thought leaders in this field:
      <span class="person">Francesca Bria</span>,
      <span class="person">Meredith Whittaker</span> (President of Signal Foundation), 
      <span class="person">Robin Berjon</span>,

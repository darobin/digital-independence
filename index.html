    <h1>Towards European Digital Independence</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Building the Euro Stack</p>

    <p>
      <span class="lead">A New European Digital Deal.</span>
      <span class="sublead">We want the European Union to gain leadership in digital technologies that are crucial for 
      our democracy, our security and our prosperity.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      For this purpose, we should leverage Europe's strengths: openness, diversity, the ability to work together as a 
      network, talent and creativity. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past mandate, the European Union has pioneered important regulation to tackle the dominance of Big Tech 
      companies as gatekeepers and to shape a democratic information ecosystem in the digital realm. Nevertheless, we 
      still see Europe heavily relying on US tech corporations that stifle competition and innovation in Europe, and 
      take possession of the world's creativity. At the same time we witness autocratic regimes investing higher shares 
      of GDP in digital technologies than European democracies. Now is the time to create open digital standards and a 
      digital infrastructure that boost the competitiveness of European companies, to seize economic opportunities for 
      cooperation with other areas of the world that have been fostering and investing in digital autonomy (e.g.  India, 
      Brazil, Taiwan) and to enhance the resilience of our democracy. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Europe needs to state that it wants to pursue a robust set of open and interoperable digital infrastructure components 
      that empower intelligence at the edges, so as to support European digital services in commerce, cloud, education, 
      healthcare, energy, climate, media, and culture. This will establish a dynamic environment for businesses of all 
      sizes. In turn, European citizens will gain greater agency over their digital lives and the ability to rely on 
      public digital infrastructures governed in an accountable and democratic way. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The "European Digital Deal" focuses on three major components: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        open protocols, interoperability as well as open source software to unlock the potential and increase the competitiveness 
        of European companies and start-ups;
      </li>
      <li>
        a robust investment programme in a 'European Digital Stack': hardware, bandwidth, infrastructures for data creation, 
        collection, and storage that such protocols will run on;
      </li>
      <li>
        strong and effective competition enforcement and regulation.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The European Digital Deal will be first presented in an event at the European Parliament  DATE XXX hosted by MEPs Axel Voss 
      (EPP), Alexandra  Geese (Greens) plus XXX XXX XXX. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The event will focus on digital public infrastructure and leverage real-world experiences to show how we can plan and
      implement a European digital public infrastructure and public interest technology in this mandate. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A unique set of experts from around the world will showcase what digital public infrastructure is, how it works, how 
      it maximises benefits for citizens, innovators, public administrations, and how Europe can build it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We have secured participation with specific use cases from Beckn (the developers of the leading open protocol) in 
      India, Audrey Tang former Digital minister of Taiwan, Luca Belli involved in the Brazilian project - all of whom 
      would be coming to speak at the EP event. We also have support from SITRA the innovation fund arm of the Finnish 
      Government, the German Sovereign Tech Fund and the EDIC on Digital Commons.  We have support from Project Liberty 
      in the US/Europe, and from a large number of thought leaders in this field - from Francesca Bria to Meredith 
      Whittaker (President of Signal Foundation), Robin Berjon, Maria Farrell, Marietje Schaake, Francesco Bonfiglio 
      (former CEO of Gaia X), Mark Nottingham, Amba Kak and Sarah Myers West at AI Now, Glen Weyl and several more...
